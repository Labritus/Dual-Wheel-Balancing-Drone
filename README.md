Inspired by Elements from Rainbow Six Siege Drones
The drones in the game feature agile movement and information gathering, crucial for tactical deployment.
The dual-wheel balance and stealth allow them to navigate complex environments, providing a creative basis for design.

We would like to design a drone which is capable of:
-Real-Time Video Transmission
  Controlling via mobile-phone, controller, or computer.
-Real-Time Video Transmission
  Equipped with high-resolution cameras to ensure clear images and stable frame rates for real-time monitoring.
-Object Recognition
  Applying deep learning algorithms for precise identification of family members, pets, and anomalies.
